Eagle Plotter
=============

This is a project that demonstrates the expressiveness and computational power
of the [Eagle programming language](https://github.com/samhorlbeck/eagle-lang).
The plotter will take any mathematical expression and render it on a graph. As
part of its functionality, it will respect order of operations, basic function
calling, and associativity rules. This tool can be used to graph such expressions
and customize the image output.

Below is an example of graph output:

![A quick function]
(/trig.png?raw=true "Sin(x), Cos(x), Rand(Sin(x), Cos(x))")

Running
------
For now it is advisable to simply use the source code as a guide for parameter
options. In the current state it would be required to both compile the Eagle
compiler as well as the code in this repository to run this plotter. Rather
it is more interesting to browse the code to get a feeling for the language
itself.
