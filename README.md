Eagle Plotter
=============

This is a project that demonstrates the expressiveness and computational power
of the [Eagle programming language](https://github.com/samhorlbeck/eagle-lang).
The plotter will take any mathematical expression and render it on a graph. As
part of its functionality, it will respect order of operations, basic function
calling, and associativity rules. This tool can be used to graph such expressions
and customize the image output.

Below is an example of graph output:

![A quick function]
(/trig.png?raw=true "Sin(x), Cos(x), Rand(Sin(x), Cos(x))")
